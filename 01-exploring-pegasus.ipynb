    "To formulate a problem for a D-Wave quantum computer, by programming $q_i$ and $q_{i,j}$ so that assignments of $x_1,...,x_N$ also represent solutions to the problem, requires that the problem graph be mapped to the QPU.

For example, the Boolean AND, represented by a fully connected graph of three nodes, $K_3$, shown on the left side of the figure below, cannot be mapped directly to qubits in the Chimera topology used by previous QPUs. Instead, the graph is mapped to four qubits that are coupled so two qubits (e.g., 0 and 4 here) form a chain to represent one variable (here $z$), as shown in the middle and right parts of the figure.\n",

As you saw in the previous sections, Advantage performs relatively better as problem sizes require embeddings with increasing chain lengths, and a random graph might be embedded more or less well, on either topology, for any particular execution of the embedding heuristic. Additionally, for submitted problems (where you are looking at returned solutions rather than just embeddings), the values set for linear and quadratic biases may also be a better fit for one QPU or the other. \n",
